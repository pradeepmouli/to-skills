### `Culler`

The Culler class is responsible for managing and culling containers.
Culling optimizes rendering performance by skipping objects outside the visible area.

> [!IMPORTANT] culling is not always a golden bullet, it can be more expensive than rendering
> objects that are not visible, so it is best used in scenarios where you have many objects
> that are not visible at the same time, such as in large scenes or games with many sprites.

```ts
constructor(): Culler
```

**Properties:**

- `shared: Culler` — A shared instance of the Culler class. Provides a global culler instance for convenience.
  **Methods:**
- `cull(container: Container, view: RectangleLike, skipUpdateTransform: boolean): void` — Culls the children of a specific container based on the given view rectangle.
  This determines which objects should be rendered and which can be skipped.

```ts
import { Culler, Container, Rectangle } from 'pixi.js';

// Create a culler and container
const culler = new Culler();
const stage = new Container();

// Set up container with culling
stage.cullable = true;
stage.cullArea = new Rectangle(0, 0, 800, 600);

// Add some sprites that will be culled
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  const sprite = Sprite.from('texture.png');
  sprite.x = Math.random() * 2000;
  sprite.y = Math.random() * 2000;
  sprite.cullable = true;
  stage.addChild(sprite);
}

// Cull objects outside view
culler.cull(stage, {
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
  width: 800,
  height: 600
});

// Only visible objects will be rendered
renderer.render(stage);
```

### `DOMContainer`

The DOMContainer object is used to render DOM elements within the PixiJS scene graph.
It allows you to integrate HTML elements into your PixiJS application while maintaining
proper transform hierarchy and visibility.

DOMContainer is especially useful for rendering standard DOM elements
that handle user input, such as `<input>` or `<textarea>`.
This is often simpler and more flexible than trying to implement text input
directly in PixiJS. For instance, if you need text fields or text areas,
you can embed them through this container for native browser text handling.

--------- EXPERIMENTAL ---------

This is a new API, things may change and it may not work as expected.
We want to hear your feedback as we go!

_extends `ViewContainer<never>`_

```ts
constructor(options: DOMContainerOptions): DOMContainer
```

**Properties:**

- `autoGarbageCollect: boolean` — If set to true, the resource will be garbage collected automatically when it is not used.
- `_updateFlags: number`
- `renderGroup: RenderGroup`
- `parentRenderGroup: RenderGroup`
- `parentRenderGroupIndex: number`
- `didChange: boolean`
- `didViewUpdate: boolean`
- `relativeRenderGroupDepth: number`
- `children: ContainerChild[]` — The array of children of this container. Each child must be a Container or extend from it.

The array is read-only, but its contents can be modified using Container methods.

- `parent: Container<ContainerChild>` — The display object container that contains this display object.
  This represents the parent-child relationship in the display tree.
- `includeInBuild: boolean`
- `measurable: boolean`
- `isSimple: boolean`
- `parentRenderLayer: RenderLayer` — The RenderLayer this container belongs to, if any.
  If it belongs to a RenderLayer, it will be rendered from the RenderLayer's position in the scene.
- `localTransform: Matrix` — Current transform of the object based on local factors: position, scale, other stuff.
  This matrix represents the local transformation without any parent influence.
- `relativeGroupTransform: Matrix` — The relative group transform is a transform relative to the render group it belongs too. It will include all parent
  transforms and up to the render group (think of it as kind of like a stage - but the stage can be nested).
  If this container is is self a render group matrix will be relative to its parent render group
- `groupTransform: Matrix` — The group transform is a transform relative to the render group it belongs too.
  If this container is render group then this will be an identity matrix. other wise it
  will be the same as the relativeGroupTransform.
  Use this value when actually rendering things to the screen
- `destroyed: boolean` — Whether this object has been destroyed. If true, the object should no longer be used.
  After an object is destroyed, all of its functionality is disabled and references are removed.
- `_origin: ObservablePoint` — The origin point around which the container rotates and scales.
  Unlike pivot, changing origin will not move the container's position.
- `boundsArea: Rectangle` — An optional bounds area for this container. Setting this rectangle will stop the renderer
  from recursively measuring the bounds of each children and instead use this single boundArea.

> [!IMPORTANT] This is great for optimisation! If for example you have a
> 1000 spinning particles and you know they all sit within a specific bounds,
> then setting it will mean the renderer will not need to measure the
> 1000 children to find the bounds. Instead it will just use the bounds you set.

- `_didContainerChangeTick: number` — A value that increments each time the containe is modified
  eg children added, removed etc
- `_didViewChangeTick: number` — A value that increments each time the container view is modified
  eg texture swap, geometry change etc
- `_accessibleActive: boolean` (optional)
- `_accessibleDiv: AccessibleHTMLElement` (optional)
- `_renderId: number` (optional)
- `accessible: boolean` (optional) — Flag for if the object is accessible. If true AccessibilityManager will overlay a
  shadow div with attributes set
- `accessibleTitle: string` (optional) — Sets the title attribute of the shadow div
  If accessibleTitle AND accessibleHint has not been this will default to 'container [tabIndex]'
- `accessibleHint: string` (optional) — Sets the aria-label attribute of the shadow div
- `tabIndex: number` (optional) — Sets the tabIndex of the shadow div. You can use this to set the order of the
  elements when using the tab key to navigate.
- `accessibleType: keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap` (optional) — Specify the type of div the accessible layer is. Screen readers treat the element differently
  depending on this type. Defaults to button.
- `accessiblePointerEvents: PointerEvents` (optional) — Specify the pointer-events the accessible div will use
  Defaults to auto.
- `accessibleText: string` (optional) — Sets the text content of the shadow
- `accessibleChildren: boolean` (optional) — Setting to false will prevent any children inside this container to
  be accessible. Defaults to true.
- `cullArea: Rectangle` (optional) — Custom shape used for culling calculations instead of object bounds.
  Defined in local space coordinates relative to the object.
  > [!NOTE]
  > Setting this to a custom Rectangle allows you to define a specific area for culling,
  > which can improve performance by avoiding expensive bounds calculations.
- `cullable: boolean` (optional) — Controls whether this object should be culled when out of view.
  When true, the object will not be rendered if its bounds are outside the visible area.
- `cullableChildren: boolean` (optional) — Controls whether children of this container can be culled.
  When false, skips recursive culling checks for better performance.
- `_internalEventMode: EventMode`
- `isInteractive: () => boolean` — Determines if the container is interactive or not
- `cursor: string & {} | Cursor` (optional) — The cursor style to display when the mouse pointer is hovering over the object.
  Accepts any valid CSS cursor value or custom cursor URL.
- `eventMode: EventMode` (optional) — Enable interaction events for the Container. Touch, pointer and mouse events are supported.
- `interactive: boolean` (optional) — Whether this object should fire UI events. This is an alias for `eventMode` set to `'static'` or `'passive'`.
  Setting this to true will enable interaction events like `pointerdown`, `click`, etc.
  Setting it to false will disable all interaction events on this object.
- `interactiveChildren: boolean` (optional) — Controls whether children of this container can receive pointer events.

Setting this to false allows PixiJS to skip hit testing on all children,
improving performance for containers with many non-interactive children.

- `hitArea: IHitArea` (optional) — Defines a custom hit area for pointer interaction testing. When set, this shape will be used
  for hit testing instead of the container's standard bounds.
