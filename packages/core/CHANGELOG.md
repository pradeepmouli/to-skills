# @to-skills/core

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Smart Quick Reference: only show annotated exports for large packages

  For packages with 30+ exports, Quick Reference now shows only exports with
  @useWhen, @category, or @remarks (author-marked as important). Others get
  a count-only summary pointing to references/. Small packages (<30) still
  show everything.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Switch When to Use from tables to bullet lists, matching published skill conventions

  BREAKING: When to Use section now uses bullet lists instead of markdown tables.
  - Multi-source attribution: "Display images → use `Sprite`" (not table rows)
  - Avoid when: "**Do NOT use when:**" bullet list
  - NEVER rules: own "## NEVER" section (not folded into When to Use)
  - parseBulletList joins non-bulleted paragraphs (fixes multi-row table corruption)
  - Description: package.json tagline + first @useWhen (truncated to 80 chars) + keywords

## 0.16.2

### Patch Changes

- Description uses keywords, not @useWhen sentences

  @useWhen content stays in the body "When to Use" section (decision tables).
  Description field uses package.json tagline + domain keywords for agent activation.
  Prevents run-on descriptions from concatenating full @useWhen sentences.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- Description from package.json only, Quick Start extracts first code block when too long
  - buildDescription uses package.json tagline (not @packageDocumentation summary)
  - @packageDocumentation summary stays in body intro only
  - Quick Start cap extracts first complete code block instead of truncating to pointer

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- Audit recommends primary sources when secondary sources are insufficient
  - A4: when README Quick Start >20 lines and no @example exists, recommend adding @example (warning)
  - W5: when README Features missing, recommend @packageDocumentation @remarks as primary alternative
  - W6: when README Troubleshooting missing, recommend @never tags as primary alternative
  - Quick Start capped at 30 lines in SKILL.md body with pointer to references

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Quick Reference cap, word-boundary truncation, per-skill README resolution
  - Quick Reference capped at 30 lines with pointer to references/ for full API
  - Description truncation falls back to word boundary instead of mid-word cut
  - README resolved per-skill in "resolve" entryPointStrategy (no more shared root README)

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- Rename @pitfalls to @never, fold NEVER rules into When to Use section

  Breaking: @pitfalls tag renamed to @never. The tag content is unchanged — NEVER + BECAUSE format.
  NEVER rules now render inside "## When to Use" as a **NEVER:** subsection instead of a separate
  "## Pitfalls" heading, matching hand-written skill conventions.

## 0.13.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix description truncation inside backtick-quoted identifiers (e.g. `?z2f`)
  - truncateDescription regex now skips .!? inside backticks
  - buildDescription combines package.json tagline with JSDoc keywords when both exist

## 0.13.3

### Patch Changes

- Compare first sentences when choosing between package.json and JSDoc descriptions

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- Prefer longer JSDoc description over package.json for richer trigger keywords

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix @remarks not extracted in single-package mode, deduplicate examples.md
  - extractModule now extracts @remarks from module comment (was only in mergeModules)
  - examples.md only created for 2+ examples (first example is Quick Start in SKILL.md body)

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [`f9cc01d`](https://github.com/pradeepmouli/to-skills/commit/f9cc01dc46bfe00467afe4e82eec6b557ca8e3f3) Thanks [@pradeepmouli](https://github.com/pradeepmouli)! - Surface @remarks as thinking framework, fix decision table Why column, broaden Quick Start aliases
  - Extract @remarks from @packageDocumentation and render in SKILL.md body (architectural context, trade-offs)
  - Decision table uses 2-column format (Task | Use) when no explicit reasons exist via " — " delimiter
  - When explicit " — " reasons exist, 3-column format (Task | Use | Why) with the author's reasoning
  - Add "cli usage", "basic usage", "installation" as Quick Start heading aliases

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add loading triggers for reference files and populate decision table Why column
  - SKILL.md now has a "## References" section with scenario-based loading triggers
    telling agents when to read each reference file (functions, classes, config, docs, etc.)
  - Decision table "Why" column uses the source function/class description instead of blank "—"
  - Fixes the [#1](https://github.com/pradeepmouli/to-skills/issues/1) skill-judge structural failure: orphaned references (Pattern 3)

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix pitfall multi-line formatting, description keyword-stuffing, redundant keyword bullets

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

  When rendered content exceeds the token budget and items have @category
  or sourceModule grouping, emit one reference file per group in
  references/<kind>/<group>.md instead of truncating into one file.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- Aggregate @useWhen/@avoidWhen/@pitfalls from classes, not just functions. Added tags field to ExtractedClass.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix skill name generation for PascalCase/camelCase module names

  toSkillName now converts camelCase/PascalCase to kebab-case before
  lowercasing. JsonSchema → json-schema, ZodBuilder → zod-builder.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Progressive disclosure: SKILL.md is now a lean discovery document, with full API details in references/

  Skills now generate a file tree instead of a single monolithic file:
  - `SKILL.md` — frontmatter, overview, when-to-use, quick reference (~500 tokens)
  - `references/functions.md` — full function signatures, params, examples
  - `references/classes.md` — class details with constructors, methods, properties
  - `references/types.md` — type definitions and enums
  - `references/examples.md` — usage examples

  Agents load SKILL.md first (cheap), then fetch references on demand.
