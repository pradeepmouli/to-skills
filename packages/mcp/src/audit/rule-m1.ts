/**
 * Audit rule M1 — missing tool description (FR-040).
 *
 * @remarks
 * MCP agents surface tools to users via their `description` text — a tool
 * with no description is effectively invisible at the call site, since the
 * harness has nothing to render in tool-picker UIs. We therefore treat an
 * empty/whitespace-only description as `fatal`: the rendered SKILL.md is
 * structurally complete, but the underlying server is mis-built and any
 * downstream consumer should refuse to publish it.
 *
 * Per-tool granularity: one issue is emitted per offending function so that
 * users see exactly which tool needs the fix. The aggregator sorts
 * results by severity then code, keeping output deterministic.
