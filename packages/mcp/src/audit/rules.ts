/**
 * Audit aggregator — runs all MCP audit rules against a skill and returns
 * the union of issues in deterministic order.
 *
 * @remarks
 * **Ordering.** Issues are sorted first by severity descending
 * (`fatal > error > warning > alert`), then by code ascending
 * (`M1 < M2 < M3 < M4 < M5`). Stable secondary tiers (per-tool issues from
 * the same rule) preserve their relative order from the rule's own output,
 * so we get a fully reproducible sort across runs — important for CI diff
 * stability when audit output is captured to files.
 *
 * **Freshness (M5) is opt-in.** The freshness rule needs an embedded
 * fingerprint AND an installed adapter, neither of which are available at
 * extract time. Bundle mode passes both; extract mode does not. When either
 * argument is absent, M5 is skipped — silently, because "not enough context
 * to check freshness" is normal, not an audit gap.
