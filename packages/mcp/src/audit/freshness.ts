/**
 * Audit rule M5 — adapter freshness (FR-IT-013).
 *
 * @remarks
 * When a CLI-as-proxy adapter (`@to-skills/target-mcpc`, `target-fastmcp`,
 * etc.) renders a SKILL.md, it embeds its fingerprint (`adapter` + `version`)
 * into the YAML frontmatter via `generated-by:`. Later, when the skill is
 * audited (extract or bundle re-run), the embedded fingerprint is compared
 * against the currently-installed adapter's fingerprint. If the embedded
 * version is older than the installed version, the rendered output may be
 * stale (newer adapter likely produces different command shapes / setup
 * instructions) and we surface a `warning`-severity issue suggesting the user
 * re-run the bundle/extract command.
 *
 * Newer-than-installed (consumer downgraded an adapter intentionally) and
 * exactly-equal versions emit no issue — neither is a freshness concern from
 * the auditor's perspective.
 *
 * The wire-up of this rule into `extract.ts` / `bundle.ts` is deferred to
 * Phase 10 (T106). This module only provides the rule.
 *

/**

 * @remarks
 * We deliberately avoid pulling in the `semver` package — this is a one-rule
 * comparator and the dependency cost is unjustified. The implementation:
 *
 * 1. Strips a leading `v` if present.
 * 2. Drops any prerelease/build suffix (`-alpha`, `+build`) — prerelease
 *    semantics are not relevant to the freshness check (a `1.0.0-rc.1` and
 *    a `1.0.0` register as equal here, which is fine: stale prerelease
 *    output is not actionable in the same way as a stale stable release,
 *    and Phase 10 can add finer rules if needed).
 * 3. Splits the remaining string on `.` and parses the first three parts as
 *    integers, treating missing parts as 0.
 * 4. Compares left-to-right and returns -1 / 0 / 1.
 *
 * Critically this avoids the `'1.0.10' < '1.0.2'` lexicographic bug that a
 * naive string compare would hit.
