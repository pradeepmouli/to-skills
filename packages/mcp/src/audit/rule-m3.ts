/**
 * Audit rule M3 — missing `useWhen` annotation (FR-040).
 *
 * @remarks
 * `useWhen` is the trigger phrase that tells an agent when to load a skill.
 * Without it, the LLM has no signal to discover the skill in context — the
 * skill renders fine but is functionally unreachable from the host harness.
 * This rule fires `warning` severity: the output is valid, but the operator
 * almost certainly intended to ship triggers and forgot.
 *
 * **Two paths, two messages.**
 *  - **Tool-level**: each function whose `tags.useWhen` is missing gets one
 *    warning. The location names the tool so the operator can fix it
 *    directly. Capped at 5 to avoid drowning the audit on a 50-tool server;
 *    a single "+ N more tools missing useWhen" summary closes the gap.
 *  - **Server-level**: when BOTH `skill.useWhen` is empty AND no tool
 *    contributed a `tags.useWhen`, one additional issue (no `location`)
 *    fires telling the operator there is no global trigger either. This
 *    avoids the false-positive case where a server-level `useWhen` covers
 *    every tool and the per-tool warnings would be noise.
 *
 * Decision: per-tool warnings always emit when missing — the server-level
 * issue is *additive*, not a replacement. Operators routinely supply both
 * (one global + per-tool overrides), and partial coverage is normal during
 * authoring.
