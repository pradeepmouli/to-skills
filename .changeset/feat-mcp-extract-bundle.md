Extract and bundle MCP servers as Agent Skills (`@to-skills/mcp` + invocation-target adapters)

New host package and three invocation-target adapters land at `0.1.0`:

- `@to-skills/mcp` — CLI + programmatic API for extracting a SKILL.md from a live Model Context Protocol server (stdio or HTTP) and bundling a server's own skill into its npm package via a `to-skills.mcp` field. Ships `to-skills-mcp extract` and `to-skills-mcp bundle` subcommands plus `extractMcpSkill` / `bundleMcpSkill` programmatic entry points. Adds an in-package `llms.txt` emitter wired to the `--llms-txt` flag.
- `@to-skills/target-mcp-protocol` — default invocation-target adapter; emits `mcp:` frontmatter for MCP-native agent harnesses (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex).
- `@to-skills/target-mcpc` — CLI-as-proxy adapter for Apify's `mcpc@^2.1`. Renders shell-command skills consumable by any harness with a shell tool.
- `@to-skills/target-fastmcp` — CLI-as-proxy adapter for the Python `fastmcp@^2` CLI; mirrors the mcpc adapter's shape with Python-side install instructions.

`@to-skills/core` extensions (backward-compatible — existing extractors continue to produce non-MCP skills unchanged):

- New IR fields on `ExtractedSkill`: `resources?: ExtractedResource[]`, `prompts?: ExtractedPrompt[]`, `setup?: SkillSetup`.
- New types: `ExtractedResource`, `ExtractedPrompt`, `ExtractedPromptArgument`, `SkillSetup`, `AdapterFingerprint`, `InvocationAdapter`, `AdapterRenderContext`.
- `renderSkill` extension points: `invocation` adapter dispatch with per-adapter context (`launchCommand`, `httpEndpoint`, `packageName`, `binName`); `additionalFrontmatter` for adapters that delegate body rendering to core; `bodyPrefix` for prepending Setup sections; `skipDefaultFunctionsRef` for adapters owning the Tools section; `canonicalize: false` for adapters that wrap core's renderer and post-process references.
- New helpers: `canonicalize` (alphabetized frontmatter + stable line endings + heading normalization for content-identical re-runs), `renderResourcesReference` and `renderPromptsReference` for MCP-side reference files.
